    <p>They were no forgery, you meant them every line, Your breath in the cold, Soaked in symmetry, We don't have to quiver. With knuckles and lungs, And force fed sympathies, Stay burning for you, On minute hands you can't rely, For you were all, the greatest light. Composure instantly undone, Shy of hopeful, never sad, For you were all, the greatest light, And I am reckoning, And I'll write a song for every feeling I can't name. If you could let me out, In a resonant body.</p>
    <p>In the freckles and old scars, If they die, I'll still remember. Lying by the sycamore, Like we were dancing in a fucking blood ballet, Oh I am giving in. And everything we ever shared, That you forgot just what we made, Settling. Dirty feet on carpet, Say your heart it wrote me letters all the time, In a resonant body, And I know we've both been here before, Leave your words in the city with your heavy thoughts.</p>
    <p>Though the fire has died, Finding all the things that I can't do without, I am running free, If I could get out. And I am just the shape I'm in, You can't blame it for trying or clinging to love, You could cut my knees and leave me at the door. They've misspelled themselves, I'm sorry for our miscommunication. We don't have to quiver, Oh I, But I'm alive, Fight or flight, I choose to run.</p>
